"""Turns an exported timeline into a CSV for Portfolio Performance.

    python3 timelineExporterWithDocsAndDetails.py
    python3 timelineCsvConverter.py

Reads myTimeline.json and, when it is there, myTimelineDetails.json, and
writes myTransactions.csv.

Without the details there are no share counts, no prices and no isins,
because a timeline entry carries none of those - only its total amount. The
converter still writes those entries, with the columns left empty.

Entries whose eventType the converter does not know are reported at the end
rather than dropped in silence, so a new kind of event does not quietly
disappear from the export.
